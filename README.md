# Cereal64
An N64 ROM serialization library

This will be used to de-serialize the bytes in an N64 ROM to better allow access/editing of the information within it. Right now is focused on the Fast3D family microcode for graphics.

# VisObj64

This project will create OpenGl graphics from/to Fast3D family microcode. Ideally it will allow for dynamic changes to the graphics that can be reflected back to the microcode. Ideally. We'll see what happens.
